# 2020-microHippos-pairs game

Game instructions:

The aim of the game is to find all matching pairs,
Click on two squares to see the devs who are there.
Each turn, try to remember their places,
When you have found a matching pair you will still see their faces.

If pairing all the devs is done, then the matching game is won!
